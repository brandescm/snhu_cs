# snhu_cs210 Project Three

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  * This project reads a list of items stored in a file and displays them by the users choice.   
  * Option 1 prints all the items along with the quantity of each
  * Option 2 prints a user selectable item with quantity
  * Option 3 prints the items with a histogram of the quantity 

### What did you do particularly well?   
  * Main loop is simple and most of the functionality is pushed to functions.   
  * Separate function to handle user input

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?   
  * Update the ShowMenu function with for loop and const strings
  * Update ClearScreen function to work with multiple Os

### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?   
  * The CreateHistogram function caused me the most issue. Honestly I have no idea why reading a file and printing it out was such a hassle.   

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?   
  * The read/write from a file   
  * The hybrid c++ and python interaction

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  * All code was maintained in Git repo (BitBucket)
  * Comments for all functions
  * Standard formatting with spaces
